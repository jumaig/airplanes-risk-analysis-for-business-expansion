## Business Problem
The expansion into a new business segment presents challenges in identifying low-risk aircraft. Without proper insights, ineffective purchases, wasted resources, and missed opportunities could occur.

---

## Objectives
- Gain insights into the potential risks of different aircraft types.
- Identify low-risk aircraft suitable for the new aviation business.
- Provide actionable insights to guide aircraft purchasing decisions.

---

## Research Questions
1. What are the potential risk trends for different types of aircraft?
2. Which factors influence the identification of low-risk aircraft?
3. Can historical data predict future aircraft purchasing behavior?

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Obtain historical aviation accident and incident data.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Develop relevant features for analysis and modeling.
4. **Analysis and Interpretation:** Extract actionable insights from the data.
